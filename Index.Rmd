## Introduction

This portfolio represents the skills I have learned using R programming and ArcGIS Pro to create maps and use spatial data. These products demonstrate an understanding of visualization, spatial relationships, routes and networks, raster data, and interactive maps. I used R to understand spatial relationships at various scales, using administrative data, survey data, and crowd-sourced data. Displaying spatial data on maps can be useful in reports, posters, and web-based documents. 


# Multiple Vector Layers

This map used an OpenStreet basemap and spatial data from the Cambridge, Massachusetts. Parks are represented by polygons and the locations of fire stations are represented as points.

# Georeferencing

This historic map of Reykajavik, Iceland in 1902 is part of the Harvard Map Collection. This map was selected and scanned during a visit to the Harvard Maps Collection. The scanned map was georeferenced using ArcGIS Pro. Using a spatial dataset from the Icelandic government, one can see the changing coastline of Reykajavik.

# Interactive Maps

These are two interactive maps of Orange County, California that use data available from the United States Census API.

# Spatial Releationships

The following maps of Boston, Massachusetts demonstrate spatial relationships between points and polygons. 

The average distance between libraries and the nearest electric-vehicle (EV) charging station.

The number of EV charging stations within each Boston neighborhood.

The density of EV charging stations within each Boston neighborhood.

EV charging stations by distance to a library.

# Accessibility

This map of Detroit, Michigan shows the number of transit stops within each grid cell.

[![](fullsize/TransitStops.jpg)](https://keanaflores27.github.io/portfolio/fullsize/TransitStops.jpg){target="_blank"}

This map shows the number of transit stops within a 10 minute walk from each point in the grid. 

[![](fullsize/TransitStops2.jpg)](https://keanaflores27.github.io/portfolio/fullsize/TransitStops2.jpg){target="_blank"}


Using a half-life exponential function and a cutoff value of 5 minutes, we can create an accessibility score for transit access in Detroit.

## Raster Data

This map creates a raster layer from a polygon layer to show the pedestrian access to transit stops in Detroit, Michigan.

## Points From Grid Cells

This map creates a vector layer from a raster layer to show pedestrian access to transit stops in Detroit.

## Polyons from Grid Cells

This map recreates the polygon layer on a square grid.

## Contours

This map displays the polygon boundaries as countours.
